# Streamlit Cheat Sheet - `stlite` Conversion Example

This directory contains an example of a Streamlit application, the "Streamlit Cheat Sheet," which has been converted into a self-contained `stlite` application using the `script2stlite` package.

## `script2stlite` and `stlite`

The `script2stlite` package is a useful tool for converting existing Streamlit applications into `stlite` applications. `stlite` allows you to run Streamlit apps entirely in the browser, packaged as a single HTML file. This is incredibly beneficial as it eliminates the need for traditional server-side hosting, making deployment simpler and more accessible.

With `stlite`, your Streamlit app becomes a portable HTML file that can be easily shared or hosted on static web hosting services like GitHub Pages.

## Original Application Credit

The original "Streamlit Cheat Sheet" application was created by **Daniel Lewis**. We extend our gratitude to him for developing this excellent resource for the Streamlit community.

This demonstrates how `script2stlite` can transform a standard Streamlit app into a browser-runnable `stlite` app, maintaining its functionality without requiring a Python backend.
