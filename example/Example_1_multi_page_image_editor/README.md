# Example 1: Multi-Page Image Editor - Using `script2stlite`

This example demonstrates how to use `script2stlite` to convert a multi-page Streamlit application, specifically an image editor, into a single self-contained HTML file. This application includes multiple Python files organized in a `pages` directory, an assets folder, and specific package requirements.

`script2stlite` is a tool that packages your Streamlit application, along with its dependencies, into an HTML file that can be run in a web browser using [stlite](https://github.com/whitphx/stlite), without needing a Python backend server.

## Application Structure

The Image Editor application has the following structure:

-   `app.py`: The main entry point for the Streamlit application. It sets up the overall page configuration.
-   `pages/`: This directory contains the different pages of the application:
    -   `01_Home.py`: The landing page.
    -   `02_Upload_Image.py`: Page for uploading images.
    -   `03_Adjust_Image.py`: Page for performing image adjustments like brightness, contrast, rotation, and grayscale.
-   `assets/`: Contains static assets, like a sample image (`image.png`).
-   `settings.yaml`: The configuration file for `script2stlite`.

## Steps to Convert This Streamlit App

The process is similar to the simple app example, focusing on the configuration within `settings.yaml` to handle the multi-page structure and dependencies.

### 1. Install `script2stlite`

Ensure you have `script2stlite` installed. If not, you can typically install it using pip:

```bash
pip install script2stlite
```
*(Note: Refer to the main project README for the most up-to-date installation instructions.)*

### 2. Prepare Your Project Folder

If you were starting from scratch, you would use `converter.prepare_folder()`. This command creates a `settings.yaml` file (if one doesn't exist) and a `pages` directory. For this example, these are already provided.

```python
from script2stlite import Script2StliteConverter

# Initialize the converter for this example's directory
converter = Script2StliteConverter("example/Example_1_multi_page_image_editor")

# Prepare the folder (optional if settings.yaml and pages/ already exist)
# converter.prepare_folder()
```

### 3. Review and Modify `settings.yaml`

The `settings.yaml` file is key to correctly packaging the multi-page application. Here's the content for this `Example_1_multi_page_image_editor`:

```yaml
APP_NAME: "Image Editor"
APP_REQUIREMENTS:
  - streamlit
  - Pillow # For image manipulation
APP_ENTRYPOINT: app.py # Main app file that sets page config
CONFIG: false
APP_FILES:
  - pages/01_Home.py
  - pages/02_Upload_Image.py
  - pages/03_Adjust_Image.py
  - assets/image.png
```

Key aspects for a multi-page app:

-   **`APP_NAME`**: Defines the application's title and the output HTML filename (e.g., `Image_Editor.html`).
-   **`APP_REQUIREMENTS`**: Lists necessary Python packages. `Pillow` is crucial for the image processing features. Remember, these must be Pyodide-compatible.
-   **`APP_ENTRYPOINT`**: This should be your main script, typically the one that might contain `st.set_page_config()` and acts as the primary entry point. For multi-page apps, this is often a small `app.py` or similar, while individual pages reside in the `pages/` directory.
-   **`APP_FILES`**: This is where you list all the Python files for each page within the `pages` directory. You also include any assets like images or data files.
    -   `script2stlite` automatically recognizes and processes the `pages/` directory convention for Streamlit multi-page apps if your entry point and page files are structured correctly. Listing them explicitly ensures they are included.

### 4. Convert the Application to HTML

With `settings.yaml` configured, convert the application:

```python
from script2stlite import Script2StliteConverter

# Initialize the converter
converter = Script2StliteConverter("example/Example_1_multi_page_image_editor")

# Convert the application
converter.convert()

print(f"Conversion complete! Check for '{converter.directory}/Image_Editor.html'.")
```

This command bundles `app.py`, all files in `pages/`, the assets, and the specified requirements into `Image_Editor.html`.

### 5. View Your Application

Open the generated `Image_Editor.html` in a web browser. You should see the multi-page image editor application, allowing you to navigate between home, upload, and adjust pages.

This example showcases how `script2stlite` handles multi-page applications and dependencies, making it easy to share complex Streamlit projects as single HTML files.
